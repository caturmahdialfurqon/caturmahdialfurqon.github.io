<span style="color: #00BFFF;">GUI Programming With Python and PYQT</span> <br>

<span style="color: #fff;">The process of creating GUI-based programs (often called desktop applications or visual programs) in Python is not as easy and comfortable as when we use Visual Basic, Visual C#, Delphi, Lazarus, or similar software. In its distribution package, Python includes a standard GUI library (in the form of modules) with the name TKinter. However, creating programs using TKinter still requires extra energy. Additionally, TKinter tends to be incomplete. This means that there are still many real needs in GUI programming that have not been implemented by this library, including an appearance that is less attractive and seems a bit old-fashioned. To overcome this problem, Riverbank Computing, created a GUI library called PyQt. This book discusses Python and techniques for using the classes provided in PyQt. Discussion topics are presented in a tutorial style and accompanied by program examples and case studies. The aim is to make the concepts presented easier to understand and apply to the cases you face. PyQt is cross-platform, which means it can be used on different operating systems. We can use Linux/UNIX, Windows, or Mac OS to create web programs with Python and PyQt. Even though in this book all the example programs are demonstrated using Linux, you can still use them on Windows or other operating systems.</span>

### By. Richard Dawkins
<span style="color: #00BFFF;">The Selfish Gene</span> <br>

<span style="color: #fff;">Richard Dawkins wrote The Selfish Gene – this book about evolution based on Williams' theory in the book he wrote entitled Adaptation and Natural Selection. His view regarding this gene is that each individual only focuses on a group or organization, but still has egoism for his own interests. Synopsis After Charles Darwin stated evolution through selection as an explanation for the diversity of life, in The Selfish Gene Richard Dawkins expanded it by introducing the concept of "selfish genes" which stated that the evolution of living things could be explained as the efforts of genes to defend personal interests, namely to survive as long as possible and spread as widely as possible. vastly, in copy form, through generations of living creatures. Why is cooperation, nurturing, even self-sacrifice found among animals? At first glance, all this is difficult to reconcile with the idea of ​​evolution as a “fight for life”. The concept of selfish genes exists to explain this, as well as other cases such as the existence of social insects and the effects of genes that can extend beyond the body of their owner. But genes are just one example of a replicator, something that can make copies of itself. Dawkins proposed the idea of ​​another replicator, one that resides not in our cells but inhabits the human mind: memes. Memes are various units of human ideas and culture that can be contagious, multiply, influence human behavior, and behave evolutionary like genes that compete with each other to survive and reproduce. Genes and memes shape and control our bodies and behavior and our world, and this book makes it easy to understand both. </span>

<span style="color: #00BFFF;">The Magic of Reality</span> <br>

<span style="color: #fff;">The Magic of Reality is a book published in 2011 by British biologist Richard Dawkins, with illustrations by Dave McKean. The book was released on 15 September 2011 in the United Kingdom. This is a graphic science book aimed primarily at children and young adults. Dawkins said that this book is aimed at children aged around 12 years and over. Before the book was published, Dawkins tested it on younger readers to understand its contents with the help of adults. “I want to show you that the real world, as understood through science, has its own magic—the kind I call poetic magic: an inspiring beauty, which is all the more magical because it is real and because we can understand how it works. Reality magic is truly amazing. Awesome, and real. It's amazing because it's real.” There are many big questions that humans ask: What are all things made of? How did the universe begin? Why are there so many types of living creatures? Why is there day and night? In the past, humans answered this with myths and legends, magical stories that tried to explain natural phenomena. Now there is an explanation that is no less miraculous: science, which answers big questions by looking at and examining reality itself, studying what is truly real. This is a book that juxtaposes the answers to both types of explanation: mythical magic, and reality magic—science. </span>

### By. Richard Dawkins
<span style="color: #00BFFF;">Outgrowing God</span> <br>

<span style="color: #fff;">Should we believe in God? In this brisk introduction to modern atheism, one of the world’s greatest science writers tells us why we shouldn’t.
Richard Dawkins was fifteen when he stopped believing in God. 
Deeply impressed by the beauty and complexity of living things, he’d felt certain they must have had a designer. Learning about evolution changed his mind. Now one of the world’s best and bestselling science communicators, Dawkins has given readers, young and old, the same opportunity to rethink the big questions.
In twelve fiercely funny, mind-expanding chapters, Dawkins explains how the natural world arose without a designer—the improbability and beauty of the “bottom-up programming” that engineers an embryo or a flock of starlings—and challenges head-on some of the most basic assumptions made by the world’s religions: Do you believe in God? Which one? Is the Bible a “Good Book”? Is adhering to a religion necessary, or even likely, to make people good to one another? Dissecting everything from Abraham’s abuse of Isaac to the construction of a snowflake, Outgrowing God is a concise, provocative guide to thinking for yourself.
Praise for Outgrowing God
“My son came home from his first day in the sixth grade with arms outstretched plaintively demanding to know: ‘Have you ever heard of Jesus?’  We burst out laughing. Maybe not our finest parenting moment, given that he was genuinely distraught. He felt that he had woken up one day to a world in which his peers were expressing beliefs he found frighteningly unreasonable. He began devouring books like The God Delusion, books that helped him formulate his own arguments and helped him stand his ground. Dawkins’s new book is special in the terrain of atheists’ pleas for humanism and rationalism precisely since it speaks to those most vulnerable to the coercive tactics of religion. As Dawkins himself says in the dedication, this book is for ‘all young people when they’re old enough to decide for themselves.’ It is also, I must add, for their parents.”—Janna Levin, author of Black Hole Blues
“When someone is considering atheism I tell them to read the Bible first and then Dawkins. Outgrowing God—second only to the Bible!”—Penn Jillette, author of God, No! </span>

### By. Richard Dawkins
<span style="color: #00BFFF;">The God Delusion</span> <br>

<span style="color: #fff;">The God Delusion caused a sensation when it was published in 2006. Within weeks it became the most hotly debated topic, with Dawkins himself branded as either saint or sinner for presenting his hard-hitting, impassioned rebuttal of religion of all types. His argument could hardly be more topical. While Europe is becoming increasingly secularized, the rise of religious fundamentalism, whether in the Middle East or Middle America, is dramatically and dangerously dividing opinion around the world. In America, and elsewhere, a vigorous dispute between intelligent design and Darwinism is seriously undermining and restricting the teaching of science. In many countries religious dogma from medieval times still serves to abuse basic human rights such as womens and gay rights. And all from a belief in a God whose existence lacks evidence of any kind. Dawkins attacks God in all his forms. He eviscerates the major arguments for religion and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry and abuses children. The God Delusion is a brilliantly argued, fascinating polemic that will be required reading for anyone interested in this most emotional and important subject. </span>

<span style="color: #00BFFF;">Letter to a Christian Nation</span> <br>

<span style="color: #fff;">Humanity has had a long fascination with blood sacrifice. In fact, it has been by no means uncommon for a child to be born into this world only to be patiently and lovingly reared by religious maniacs, who believe that the best way to keep the sun on its course or to ensure a rich harvest is to lead him by tender hand into a field or to a mountaintop and bury, butcher, or burn him alive as offering to an invisible God. The notion that Jesus Christ died for our sins and that his death constitutes a successful propitiation of a “loving” God is a direct and undisguised inheritance of the superstitious bloodletting that has plagued bewildered people throughout history. . . </span>

<span style="color: #00BFFF;">The Secret History of the World by Black</span> <br>

<span style="color: #fff;">Here for the first time is a complete history of the world, from the beginning of time to the present day, based on the beliefs and writings of the secret societies. From the esoteric account of the evolution of the species to the occult roots of science, from the secrets of the Flood to the esoteric motives behind American foreign policy, here is a narrative history that shows the basic facts of human existence on this planet can be viewed from a very different angle. Everything in this history is upside down, inside out and the other way around.At the heart of "The Secret History of the World" is the belief that we can reach an altered state of consciousness in which we can see things about the way the world works that are hidden from us in our everyday, commonsensical consciousness. This history shows that by using secret techniques, people such as Leonardo da Vinci, Isaac Newton and George Washington have worked themselves into this altered state - and been able to access supernatural levels of intelligence. There have been many books on the subject, but, extraordinarily, no-one has really listened to what the secret societies themselves say. The author has been helped in his researches by his friendship with a man who is an initiate of more than one secret society, and in one case an initiate of the highest level.</span>
